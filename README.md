# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a simple console game of Rock, Paper, Scissors that I built as a learning opportunity.

The project was a way for me to practice and test out several C++ concepts, including:

*   `std::string` and utility functions
*   `if`, `else if`, and `else` conditions
*   `while` loops for continuous play
*   Using `std::srand` and `std::rand` for random number generation
